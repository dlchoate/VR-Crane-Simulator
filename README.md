XRTERRA VR crane simulator from Packet39.

Donald Choate | Tina Shang | Walter McCord

Hello and welcome to our repo for the VR crane simulator Packet39 project.

To check out the demo clone this repo and open the project in Unity.
Open MainScene in the Scenes folder and click the play button in the Unity simulator. 
A virtual reality HMD should be used for the best experience, however the levers can be
manipulated in the editor during play mode by changing their angles to manipulate the 
crane.

In the headset use the controllers to grab the levers to manipulate the crane. Try to move
the crates from the right side to the target platforms on the left side.

Feel free to try the v0.1 alpha release.
